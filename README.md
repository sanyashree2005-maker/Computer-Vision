# Computer Vision Projects Repository 

This repository contains a collection of **computer vision projects and case studies** covering fundamental to advanced concepts. Each project focuses on a specific vision task, combining **theoretical understanding** with **practical implementation** using modern computer vision and deep learning techniques.

The aim of this repository is to demonstrate how different computer vision concepts are applied to **real-world problems**, document analysis, image processing, deep learning models, and video analytics.



##  Projects Overview

### 1. Xerox JBIG2 Compression Bug – Case Study

A detailed case study analyzing the **Xerox JBIG2 compression bug**, highlighting how document image processing and compression techniques can lead to critical recognition errors. This project focuses on how scanned documents are analyzed and reconstructed, and the implications of errors in document digitization systems.



### 2. Computer Vision Pipeline

A conceptual project explaining the **end-to-end computer vision pipeline**, including:

* Data acquisition
* Image preprocessing
* Feature extraction / representation learning
* Model training and evaluation
* Inference and deployment

This serves as a foundation for understanding all other projects in the repository.



### 3. Corner Detection

Implementation of **Harris Corner Detection** to identify key interest points in images. This project demonstrates how corners are detected, visualized, and interpreted, forming the basis for many feature-based vi
### 4. LAB 1 – CNN vs Transfer Learning

A comparative study between:

* A **custom-built CNN model**
* A **pre-trained transfer learning model**

The project evaluates performance differences, training efficiency, and generalization capability, providing insights into when and why transfer learning is effective.



### 5. Feature Matching

Exploration of classical feature detection and matching techniques using:

* **SIFT**
* **SURF**
* **ORB**

This project compares these methods in terms of robustness, speed, and matching accuracy for image alignment and object recognition tasks.



### 6. LAB 2 – Semantic Segmentation

Implementation of **semantic segmentation using U-Net architecture**, integrated with **YOLO-based computer vision workflows**. The project focuses on pixel-level classification and understanding scene structures in images.



### 7. Traffic Monitoring & Video Surveillance

A real-world video analytics project involving:

* Traffic monitoring and analysis using surveillance footage
* Airport customer behavior analytics

The project extracts meaningful insights from video streams, such as movement patterns, density analysis, and behavior trends.
